Game is like level 3, but with no economic phase, and only 5 turns long.

2 players: Berserker vs Stationary player

- Berserker immediately sends its scouts to the stationary player

- Stationary player literally does nothing

During combat, the attacker always attacks the defender highest in the combat order
